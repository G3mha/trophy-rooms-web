# Nintendo Visual Identity Style Guide

This document outlines the visual design directive for the Trophy Rooms project. The goal is to align with the clean, playful, and user-friendly aesthetic of the Nintendo brand.

## Core Principles

- **Simple & Clean:** Avoid clutter. Every element should have a purpose.
- **Playful & Fun:** The design should feel engaging and delightful to use.
- **User-Friendly:** Prioritize intuitive navigation and clear information hierarchy.
- **High-Quality:** Polished presentation and smooth interactions are key.

## Color Palette

- **Primary Red:** `#E60012` - The iconic Nintendo red. Use for primary calls-to-action, highlights, and branding elements.
- **White:** `#FFFFFF` - The primary background color.
- **Light Gray:** `#F0F0F0` - For secondary backgrounds, cards, and UI elements to create subtle depth.
- **Dark Gray:** `#8C8C8C` - For secondary text and less important details.
- **Black:** `#000000` - For primary text.

## Typography

- **Font:** The primary font should be a clean, rounded, sans-serif typeface that mimics the feel of Nintendo's custom fonts. A good, readily available option is **Nunito** from Google Fonts.
- **Hierarchy:**
    - **Headings:** Bold weight.
    - **Body:** Regular weight.
    - **Labels/Captions:** Medium or Semibold weight.

## UI Elements

- **Buttons:**
    - **Shape:** Rounded corners (e.g., `border-radius: 16px` or `999px` for pills).
    - **Style:** Solid color fills. Avoid gradients or overly complex styles.
    - **Shadows:** A subtle `box-shadow` can be used to lift elements off the page.
- **Icons:**
    - **Style:** Simple, solid, and easily recognizable glyphs.
    - **Weight:** Consistent stroke weight.
- **Containers & Cards:**
    - **Shape:** Rounded corners (e.g., `border-radius: 8px` or `12px`).
    - **Separation:** Use whitespace and subtle shadows, not harsh borders.

## Logo Usage

The official Nintendo logo or related brand marks should be used in accordance with official brand guidelines and for nominative purposes only.
